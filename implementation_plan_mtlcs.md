# Implementation Plan

### Objective

I am building a website for my new client, Mazzochi Twin’s Lawn Care Service, LLC https://www.thetree4life.com/

Mazzochi Twin’s Lawn Care Service, LLC is a dedicated lawn care company committed to providing reliable, high-quality outdoor maintenance services. We take pride in delivering well-kept lawns through consistent service, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic.

Our goal is to help homeowners and property owners maintain clean, healthy, and great-looking outdoor spaces they can enjoy year-round.

### Design

Redesign this landing page to look like it was built by a top-tier modern design agency charging $50k+. Focus on:

- Subtle, sophisticated animations (micro-interactions, smooth transitions)
- A cohesive, premium color palette (avoid anything that feels "template-y")
- Polished details: shadows, gradients, borders that feel intentional and high-end
- Visual rhythm and alignment that feels considered
- Please do animation on every number on each page from 0 and count up when it scrolls into view
- Use refined typography that aligns with the company’s industry and brand identity

The only constraints are to use the attached logo in the navbar, apply fonts suited for a modern layout, follow the original website’s color theme, and ensure any hero stock imagery aligns with their core services or products.

### Copywriting

Take full liberty with the copywriting for this website. In the client's own words, this is how they describe themselves and their services. This information needs to be conveyed in a way that is marketed and comes across well to the user on the website.
